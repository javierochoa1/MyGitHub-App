"GRC is not an easy to define concept, because it means different things for different people. In essence GRC is how to best run a business or organization, includes all faucets from the ground up, how you think about the values of your company, how you think about delivering those values (those within as well as expernal to your company), as well as all those functional activities that help address risk and compliance accross the organization. Is not a specific department aspect, but really is a concept that drives accross the enterprise." <Jimmy Lin, The Network, 2014>

GRC is not having a risk management function or a compliance department working in silos, is rather a team effort. In order to carry out this trifecta of governenca, risk management and compliance you  need a team affort that drives accross the other functions of the organization. You need every department (e..g.: Operations, Product Development) on board to help carry out initiatives, to protect the organization and think about Compliance and Risk and the ethical values the company wants to drive.
